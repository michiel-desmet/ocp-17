De oefeningen zijn gehaald van https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/index-polymorphism.php

1. Write a Java program to create a base class Animal (Animal Family) with a method called Sound(). Create two
   subclasses Bird and Cat. Override the Sound() method in each subclass to make a specific sound for each animal.

2. Write a Java program to create a class Vehicle with a method called speedUp(). Create two subclasses Car and Bicycle.
   Override the speedUp() method in each subclass to increase the vehicle's speed differently.

3. Write a Java program to create a base class Shape with a method called calculateArea(). Create three subclasses:
   Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Override the calculateArea() method in each subclass to calculate and return the
   shape's area.

4. Write a Java program to create a class Employee with a method called calculateSalary(). Create two subclasses Manager
   and Programmer. In each subclass, override the calculateSalary() method to calculate and return the salary based on
   their specific roles.

5. Write a Java program to create a base class Sports with a method called play(). Create three subclasses: Football,
   Basketball, and Rugby. Override the play() method in each subclass to play a specific statement for each sport.

6. Write a Java program to create a class Shape with methods getArea() and getPerimeter(). Create three subclasses:
   Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Override the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods in each subclass to calculate and
   return the area and perimeter of the respective shapes.

7. Write a Java program to create a base class Animal with methods move() and makeSound(). Create two subclasses Bird
   and Panthera. Override the move() method in each subclass to describe how each animal moves. Also, override the
   makeSound() method in each subclass to make a specific sound for each animal.

8. Write a Java program to create a base class Shape with methods draw() and calculateArea(). Create three subclasses:
   Circle, Square, and Triangle. Override the draw() method in each subclass to draw the respective shape, and override
   the calculateArea() method to calculate and return the area of each shape.

9. Write a Java program to create a base class BankAccount with methods deposit() and withdraw(). Create two subclasses
   SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount. Override the withdraw() method in each subclass to impose different withdrawal
   limits and fees.

10. Write a Java program to create a base class Animal with methods eat() and sound(). Create three subclasses: Lion,
    Tiger, and Panther. Override the eat() method in each subclass to describe what each animal eats. In addition,
    override the sound() method to make a specific sound for each animal.

11. Write a Java program to create a base class Vehicle with methods startEngine() and stopEngine(). Create two
    subclasses Car and Motorcycle. Override the startEngine() and stopEngine() methods in each subclass to start and
    stop the engines differently.

12. Write a Java program to create a base class Shape with methods draw() and calculateArea(). Create two subclasses
    Circle and Cylinder. Override the draw() method in each subclass to draw the respective shape. In addition, override
    the calculateArea() method in the Cylinder subclass to calculate and return the total surface area of the cylinder.
